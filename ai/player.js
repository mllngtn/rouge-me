    Can our player see any other entities of note? 
    Find out by calling the scan() function (found in ai/shared.js) on any entities of note:
    1) The player sees the entity, and is told so via the UI
    2) The player hears the entity, and is told so via the UI
    3) The player neither sees nor hear the entity, which is hidden from view
    When finished, return true to let rogue.js know that we're done
