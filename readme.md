# Rouge Me

#### By Ed Millington

This is a little rogue-lite project I'm working on to get better at JavaScript.

It's not guaranteed to work in all browsers at the mo, 'cause I'm learning myself a bit of ES6, which is super fun.

## Try it yourself

Open 'rouge.html' in Chrome, and use the arrow keys to wander about.

## What's happening?

You play the part of a friendly @ sign.

Watch out! You've been dropped into a maximum security area. Use your spidey senses to your advantage.

The game will tell you if you can see or hear a guard.

The game will also tell you if a guard sees or hears you.

Er.. that's it.
